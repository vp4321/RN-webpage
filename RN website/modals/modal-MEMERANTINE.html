                Memes are one of our most vital survival tools during this quarantine as they are
            hilarious and savage at the same time so Radio NITroz conduct an event
            "MEME-RaN-TINE" where participants had a chance to showoff their awesome
            sense of humor by making memes on given list of places in the college. The event was
            very successful with 80+ participation.
